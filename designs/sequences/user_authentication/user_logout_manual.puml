@startuml User Logout & Token Invalidation
actor User
participant Frontend
participant "API Server" as API
database "Database" as DB

== User Initiates Logout ==
User -> Frontend: clicks logout button
Frontend -> API: POST /auth/logout (with JWT in Authorization header)
activate API
API -> API: extract JWT from Authorization header
alt JWT missing or invalid
    API -> API: treat as already logged out (no error)
else JWT valid
    note right of API       
        Since using stateless strategy:
        - No server-side action needed (JWT becomes invalid on client)
        - Client should discard token
    end note
    API -> DB: optionally record logout event (user_id, timestamp)
    API <-- DB: logout recorded
end
Frontend <-- API: 200 OK (logged out)
deactivate API
Frontend -> Frontend: clear JWT from storage
Frontend -> Frontend: clear user session data
User <-- Frontend: redirect to login page
