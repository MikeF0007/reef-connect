    enum MediaStatus {
        -- description --
        Represents the processing status of a media item, used to track its lifecycle from upload to
        processing, and to handle error states.
        -- values --
        PENDING -- Initial status when media upload has been initiated and a media entity has been
            initialized. This is before the actual uploading to blob storage has begun.
        UPLOADING -- Status after the media entity is initialized and media uploading to blob
            storage has begun but not finished.
        UPLOADED -- Status after the media file has been successfully uploaded to blob storage, but
            before processing has started.
        PROCESSING -- Status when media processing is currently underway.
        PROCESSED -- Status after media processing has completed successfully.
        FAILED -- Status when media processing has failed, either due to an error during upload or
            any step of the processing workflow.
    }

    enum MediaType {
        -- description --
        Represents the type of media item, used to differentiate handling and processing logic for
        different media formats.
        -- values --
        IMAGE -- Represents image media items.
        VIDEO -- Represents video media items.
    }

    enum MLTaggingStatus {
        -- description --
        Represents the status of machine learning-based tagging for a media item, used to track the
        progress and outcome of ML tagging workflows.
        -- values --
        PENDING -- Initial status when ML tagging has not yet started for a processed media item.
        SUCCESS -- Status after ML tagging has completed successfully and tags have been applied to
            the media item (if any found).
        FAILED -- Status when ML tagging has failed, either due to an error during the tagging
            process.
    }

    enum SpeciesTagSource {
        -- description --
        Represents the source of a species tag applied to a media item, used to differentiate
        between user-applied tags and those generated by machine learning models.
        -- values --
        USER -- Represents species tags that were applied by a user.
        ML -- Represents species tags that were generated by the ML tagging service.
    }

    enum Visibility {
        -- description --
        Represents the visibility level of various entities (e.g., media items, dive logs) in the
        system, used to control access and sharing settings.
        -- values --
        PUBLIC -- Represents entities that are visible to all users and can be shared publicly.
        PRIVATE -- Represents entities that are only visible to the owner and cannot be shared.
        UNLISTED -- Represents entities that are not publicly listed but can be accessed via direct
            link and shared with others.
    }
